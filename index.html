            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Anil Paudel" class="profile-pic">
            <p>I graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Tribhuwan university in Nepal,
                where I developed a
                strong foundation in engineering principles, project management, and sustainable design. My professional
                journey began in the public sector, where I have been actively involved in the planning and execution of
                various infrastructure projects for nearly five years.</p>
            <p>Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I ventured into the realm of technology to explore how it
                could intersect with my field of expertise. I have since embarked on a self-taught journey in Python
                programming, full-stack development, and artificial intelligence, all of which are now integral to my
                research and development projects.</p>
            <p>Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I am an avid reader and technology enthusiast. I enjoy
                keeping up with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning, which fuel my projects and inspire
                my long-term goals. Additionally, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences, which has
                led me to the development of a personal blog and an upcoming YouTube channel dedicated to educating
                others about engineering, technology , health and lifestyle.</p>

    <!-- Research Section -->
    <section id="research">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>My Research Interests and Current Projects</h2>
            <p>My research is driven by a fascination with the convergence of traditional civil engineering practices
                and modern computational technologies. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can be
                leveraged to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of infrastructure projects.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am focused on developing an innovative platform that utilizes AI to analyze and predict
                infrastructure degradation. This project aims to provide early warnings and maintenance suggestions,
                thereby extending the life of essential public structures and reducing repair costs. The platform
                integrates data analytics with drone technology to inspect and monitor conditions in real-time.</p>
            <p>Another key area of my research is exploring the potential of AI in urban planning. By using AI
                algorithms, I am working on models that can simulate traffic patterns and propose optimizations that
                lead to more efficient city layouts, reduced congestion, and improved air quality.</p>
            <p>These projects not only reflect my commitment to blending engineering with technology but also my passion
                for making tangible improvements in public safety and urban living conditions.</p>
